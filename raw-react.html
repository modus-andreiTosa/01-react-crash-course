        // Throughout this workshop will often manipulate react elements using props.
        // To have a good feel of what is happening under the hood we're going to do the mae thing we did in the previous example but using the basic react api.

        // In a very similar fashion to the previous example the first step is to grab the root element (div).
        const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');

        // Just like the old school DOM that we used before React has has a "createElement" function that.
        // This function takes three arguments, the first is the type of element we want to create, the second is an object of props and the third is called children.
        // The props object is optional and can be used send data to new React element.
        // The children argument is also optional and can be used to pass in other React nodes (elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes, arrays of React nodes).
        const h1 = React.createElement('h1', { className: 'fancy' }, 'Hello Modus!');
